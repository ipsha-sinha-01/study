1. difference in between pom and effective pom


The Super POM

All Maven project POMs extend the Super POM, which defines a set of defaults shared by all projects.

The Simplest POM

All Maven POMs inherit defaults from the Super POM. If you are just writing a simple project that produces a JAR from some source in src/main/java, want to run your JUnit tests in src/test/java, and want to build a project site using mvn site, you donâ€™t have to customize anything. All you would need, in this case, is the simplest possible POM shown in The Simplest POM. This POM defines a groupId, artifactId, and version: the three required coordinates for every project.

The Effective POM

The merge between the Super POM and the POM from The Simplest POM.
